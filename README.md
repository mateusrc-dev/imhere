# This application is part of Rocketseat's Ignite ReactNative trail, which aims to present the fundamentals of ReactNative üöÄüöÄ

## In this application we created an interface in which event participants can be added - this simple application helps us understand basic concepts such as componentization, hooks, basic react-native elements (Text, View, ScrollView)

### ‚û°Ô∏è We learned about the fundamentals of ReactNative, we learned how to create a project with Expo where it is simpler to create the project and it is easy to run the application directly on the iPhone device to see how it is turning out - we learned how to create the project with managed workflow (automates configurations involving native code)

‚û°Ô∏è We learned to use fundamental elements of react native and we understand that by default the organization of these elements is in columns, if we want - some elements we learned to use: Text, View, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, ScrollView, FlatList, StatusBar, etc.

‚û°Ô∏è Also in the project we learned how to work with componentization, hooks (such as useState and useEffect)

### If you want to test the application on your machine, simply download the repository and run the command "npm run start" in the repository terminal with Android Studio running
